# Catch It: A Simple [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) Game 

It was a fun experience making this project with Scratch. Now, I'm going to discuss a brief introduction about what Scratch is, its origin, and a basic overview of how it works.
<br/>
### What is Scratch? 

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free visual coding tool that was designed by the MIT. Scratch is a block-based, visual programming language that makes it easy for beginners to get into coding. It is used as an educational tool for teaching coding. Scratch was created and developed by Mitchel Resnick, Andrés Monroy-Hernández. It is a type of “block programming which uses graphical blocks to represent program commands” (Crook, 2009). Students can use Scratch to code their own interactive stories, animations, and games.

### More about Scratch
Anything created in Scratch starts as a blank project. Inside of this project is where all of your work is saved. Projects can be shared and downloaded while existing projects can be imported and further edited. Scratch projects can also be converted into other file types through the use of 3rd party software and tools, but this process can be complicated. Over 79 million projects have been shared on the Scratch website, with more added each day.

### Conclusion
Scratch is an excellent way to teach the basics. It gives a good starting platform to those completely new to coding, especially the younger audience.
